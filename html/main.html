NEWS:
</center>
<br><br>
For a long time we had the problem that many of the MP members were inactive. 
Juggernaut and North were the first to approach in Battle.net, followed by 
Azrael and MOP. Slowly almost half of the members are active, listed
below:<center> 
<br> [MP]Azrael<br> 
[MP]Gorlord<br> 
[MP]MOP<br> 
[MP]North<br> 
[MP]Juggernaut<br> 
</center>
<br> Soon we will welcome a new Member, if he has proven to be a true MP:
<br> Luminus, an old friend of us will join MP soon. Me (Azrael) played 
a few games against him, and he is really getting better from day to day... 
<br>
Crossbreed and Bestrafer are no longer MP's, not because they are not worth 
it but because of inactivity. Runelord has left the clan too, he was an
inactive member but he has left because of our "intolerance" to some game 
called "Starsiege Tribes". Another possibility would be doing an extra site
for ST players, as two of us play ST well...
So the clan has only active members for the FIRST TIME!
