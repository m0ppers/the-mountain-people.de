Starcraft Scene
</h1><p>
Unfortunatly we encountered some problems in the Starcraft Brood War - Scene.
When we founded our Clan we started off with some games against other people.
But we had no idea that there were so much guys who got a problem if
someone rumbles with his forces into their bases and is going to finish them.
They simply turn off their computer and we got the disconnects although we
almost won these games. Due to the fact that this is a common Battle.net
problem we will out these players here on our site if it was obvious that
they terminated the connection just before the final strike. So if you
encounter a player listed on this site don´t play with him but out him in the
channels. <br>
